# Ecommerce_Purchase_Case_Study

## 🧮 Methodology  
1. Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn for visualisations).  
2. Load dataset and perform initial checks (shape, missing values, types).  
3. Pre-process data: handle missing/null values, correct data types, derive useful columns if needed.  
4. Exploratory analysis:  
   - Summary statistics (mean/median/quantiles).  
   - Distribution of key variables (e.g., purchase amount, customer segments).  
   - Relationships between variables (e.g., time of purchase vs product category).  
   - Identification of high-value customers, frequent purchasers, etc.  
5. Insights & Business interpretation: draw conclusions that a business could act on.
